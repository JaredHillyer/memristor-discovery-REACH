## Create install files for all 3 operating systems### Possibilities that will be updated for Java 11 in the future1. <https://github.com/Jorl17/jar2app>1. <https://bitbucket.org/infinitekind/appbundler/overview>1. <https://lerks.blog/packaging-a-jar-as-app-for-macos/>### MacOSWe can look at the [JD-GUI app](https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui/blob/master/src/osx/resources/Info.plist) to see a good and simple example of properly bundling an app for MacOS.#### Memristor-Discovery.appBuild the mail Jar with: `mvn clean package`.Create an icns file via <https://iconverticons.com/online/>. Place under `_img` with name `icons.icns`.Manually download the MacOS OpenJDK from <http://jdk.java.net/11/>. Un-tar it.Prepare the Java 11 JDK for Packr. It requires a `jre` folder because of the the way old Java JDKs organized the directory structure. If Packr ever updates, this may not be necessary in the future, but for now it is. Create `jre` under `Contents/Home`. Move `lib` and `bin` into this new `jre` folder. You can also remove `src.zip` under `lib` as it's just extra unneeded bulk. Right-click the `jdk-11.0.2.jdk` folder and choose `compress` to create a zip file, which is required by Packr.Update `JDK_LOCATION` in `MacOSPackr` to reflect the created zip file. Run `MacOSPackr` in test package. This will create a `*.app` file which could be dragged into `Applications` and clicked on like a normal app.Open up the *.app folder and add the following to the Info.plist file:```<key>CFBundleLongVersionString</key><string>0.0.7, Copyright 2016-2019 Knowm Inc</string><key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key><string>0.0.7</string>```#### Memristor-Discovery.dmg<https://medium.com/@adam_carroll/java-packager-with-jdk11-31b3d620f4a8><http://chromasoft.blogspot.com/2010/02/building-dmg-installer-for-mac-simple.html><https://stackoverflow.com/a/37310294/1625820>To package the app in an "installer", we need to create a DMG file with a few things in it. 1. Open Disk Utility1. File ==> New Image ==> Blank Image![](_exe/DiskUtility.png)1. Mount and open the DMG in Finder1. Switch to Icon view1. Drag `*.app` into it.1. In Terminal: `cd /Volumes/Memristor-Discovery/` `ln -s /Applications Applications`1. Right-click ==> Show View Options1. Drag the DMG_Background image as the background picture.![](_exe/DMG_Setup.png)1. Eject the DMG.1. Compress it with Disk Utility. Images ==> Convert. Select DMG. Choose `compressed`, which is also read-only. (https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/disk-utility/convert-a-disk-image-to-another-format-dskutl1002/mac)### WindowsRun `WindowsPackr` in test package. This will create a folder called `Memristor-Discovery"`. Zip it.### Linux## PreferencesOn MacOS, Preferences are store in ~/Library/org.knowm.memristor. You can read the binary plist files in XCode.## JavaPackager1. <https://medium.com/@adam_carroll/java-packager-with-jdk11-31b3d620f4a8>### JDEPSTo find out which JRE deps are needed```bash/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-11.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/jdeps --list-deps /Users/timmolter/workspaces/workspace_knowm/memristor-discovery/jar/memristor-discovery-0.0.8-SNAPSHOT.jar```[Source](https://medium.com/azulsystems/using-jlink-to-build-java-runtimes-for-non-modular-applications-9568c5e70ef4)### MacOS[Download](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/openjfx-dev/2018-September/022500.html) the MacOS binary and place in `usr/local/Cellar`.```brew cask install javanano ~/.bash_profileexport JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home`echo $JAVA_HOME /usr/local/Cellar/jdk.packager-osx/jpackager --version``````mvn package```Move jar to `jar` folder manually. It needs to be isolated like this in order for `jpackager` to only pull in the jar into the final package.```cd ~/workspaces/workspace_knowm/memristor-discovery./package_macos.sh```### WindowsFor Windows, when you unpack the Java Packager bundle you’ll find two files inside. I found that I needed to move these two files into the following directories inside the JDK itself:    jpackager.exe ➔ %JAVA_HOME%\bin    jdk.packager.jar ➔ %JAVA_HOME%\jmods    `MSVCP140.dll` and `VCRUNTIME140.dll` are needed both for the packaging process and for the final running program. The files are available as a download [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) on the Microsoft website. The Microsoft installer places the missing DLL files into C:\Windows\System32.To build the installable bundle on Windows, we need the [Inno Setup software](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php).```cd /c/Users/knowm/Documents/GitHub/memristor-discovery./package_windows.bat```Open the *.iss file in Inno Setup and hit run. An installer will be created in `_exe/Output`.### Linux[Download](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/openjfx-dev/2018-September/022500.html) the Linux binary and place in `/usr/local/bin/jpackager`. There are two files: `jdk.packager.jar` and `jpackager`. ```cd /usr/local/binsudo chmod 777 jpackager/usr/local/bin/jpackager/jpackager --version``````mvn package```Move jar to `jar` folder manually. It needs to be isolated like this in order for `jpackager` to only pull in the jar into the final package.```cd ~/Github/memristor-discovery./package_linux.sh```sudo apt install ~/Github/memristor-discovery/_exe/memristor-discovery-0.0.8.deb
