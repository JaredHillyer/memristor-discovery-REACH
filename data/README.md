Data was gathered July 15, 2020 in Santa Fe NM using Memristor Discovery software 
and the Memristor Discovery Board V2 with a Knowm W-SDC memristor array chip. 
Data is in CSV format with [voltage, current]. Folders are named by experiment parameters, for example:

5kÎ©_.8V_100Hz_M2
[series resistor]_[voltage amplitude]_[frequency]_[selected memristor]
